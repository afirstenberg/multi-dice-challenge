  Multi Dice Championship Privacy Policy

<p>
  <b>Summary</b>: We don't want your data.
  Please don't give it to us.
</p>

<p>
  Multi Dice Championship is for fun and education only.
</p>

<p>
  Anything you tell us may end up in our logs, but we're not asking for anything.
  We use Google tools to help track how many times you've visited and other
  usage metrics, but that is just to get some idea of how many people don't care
  - we don't use them, and we can't track this info to your account.
</p>

<p>
  Some information such as a unique ID, your high score, and the number of times
  you have played are attached to your account as "stored data".
  You are able to view and clear this data at any time by visiting the
  Assistant Directory entry for Multi Dice Championship and selecting "View
  Stored Data" at the bottom of the page.
